# Area-of-circle-calculator
A circle area calculator is a tool that computes the area of a circle using the formula  A = π r 2 A=πr  2  , where  A A is the area and  r r is the radius. Users input the radius (or diameter, converted to radius), and the calculator provides the area. It simplifies manual calculations, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
